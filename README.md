This node Command Management System will allow you to manage a company's employees using node, inquirer, console table's and MySQL. You can use this command line application to:
- View Company Reecords
- Add Departments, Roles, and Employees
- Update an Employee's Role or Manager
- View Employees By Manager
- Delete Departments, Roles, and Employees
- View The Total Budget of a Department

If you would like to run it yourself simply download and then do an '-npm install'. After it has been initialized you can use the schema and seed file to create a database and then run command '-node server.js' to bring up the CLI.
